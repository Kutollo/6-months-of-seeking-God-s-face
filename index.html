  <h2>Purpose of the Journey</h2>
  <p>
    This journey from July to December is a sacred commitment to seek God's face with intentionality. Through fasting, daily scripture, prayer, and reflection, we aim to deepen our relationship with the Lord, grow in spiritual discipline, and align our lives with His divine purpose.
  </p>
  <p>
    July focuses on seeking God's face, developing a habit of daily intimacy through prayer, scripture, and reflection. Let this month be one of connection, focus, and intentional pursuit of His presence.
  </p>
  <p>
    August focuses on turning back to God with humble hearts, walking in obedience, and aligning with His Word. Let this month be one of repentance, renewal, and redirection.
  </p>
  <p>
    September centers on cultivating intimacy with God and building spiritual strength. This month encourages us to draw near to Him, rely on His power, and grow in steadfast faith, allowing His presence to shape our daily lives and decisions.
