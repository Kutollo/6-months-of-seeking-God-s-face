    <h2>Application Letter</h2>
    <p><strong>Kutollo Chiloane</strong><br>Johannesburg, South Africa | 076 880 0599 | kutollochix@gmail.com<br>15 June 2025</p><p>Dear Hiring Manager,</p>

<p>I am applying for a Mechanical Engineering graduate position at your company. I am a final-year BEngTech Mechanical Engineering student at the University of Johannesburg, with strong technical skills, practical design experience, and a commitment to contributing meaningfully to real-world engineering challenges.</p>

<p>My academic background has equipped me with solid knowledge in thermodynamics, mechanics, fluid dynamics, and design. For my final-year capstone project, I led the design and development of an Automatic Seed Sowing Robot for small-scale farming, applying CAD (SolidWorks), simulations, and project management. I have also completed a CFD analysis on aerofoils and participated in a Python programming bootcamp through GRIT Lab Africa, further strengthening my analytical and problem-solving abilities.</p>

<p>I am dependable, detail-oriented, and eager to learn. I work well independently and in teams, and I am confident in using tools such as AutoCAD, SolidWorks, and Microsoft Suite. I am available to start immediately part-time or full-time after graduation in November 2025.</p>

<p>Thank you for considering my application. I would welcome the opportunity to discuss how I can contribute to your team.</p>

<p>Sincerely,<br>Kutollo Chiloane</p>
